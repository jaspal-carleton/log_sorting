# Log Sorting
Log sorting - Chronologically sort 'K log sources' where each log has 'N log entries'

<br>

## Description

We have a number of [**log sources**](https://github.com/jaspal-carleton/log_sorting/blob/master/lib/log-source.js).  Each log source contains N log entries.  Each entry is a javascript object with a timestamp and message.  We don't know the number of log entries each source contains - however - we do know that the entries within each source are sorted ðŸ•’ **chronologically** ðŸ•’.

### The Objectives:
1. ***Drain all of the log sources*** for both the synchronous and asynchronous solutions.
    - [Synchronous](https://github.com/jaspal-singh/log_sorting/lib/log-source.js#L37)
    - [Asynchronous](https://github.com/jaspal-singh/log_sorting/lib/log-source.js#L45)
1. Print all of the entries, across all of the sources, in chronological order.
    - We don't need to store the log entries, just print them to stdout.
1. Do this *efficiently*. There are time and space complexities afoot!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* bluebird
* Faker
* lodash
* jest

### Prerequisites

The app requires NodeJS and NPM to be installed on the system where this application will run.

* Verify if NodeJS and NPM is already installed on your system by executing following commands from the terminal. If installed then it will output the version number.

  ```sh
  node --version
  ```

  ```sh
  npm --version
  ```

* Otherwise, download and install NodeJS v15.0.0 from https://nodejs.org/download/release/v15.0.0/ based on your system OS. This will also install NPM by default along with NodeJS.

### Installing

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jaspal-carleton/log_sorting.git
   ```
2. Change directory to the project folder
   ```sh
   cd log_sorting
   ```
3. Install NodeJS modules or packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Executing program

1. Run the app by executing following npm command from inside the project folder
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
